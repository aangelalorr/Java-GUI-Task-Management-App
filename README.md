Task Management App

JavaFX GUI

This Task Management App is aimed to break down large goals into smaller steps. It is useful to track day to day tasks you have. 
You are able to enter your task, date, and time. They are also categoried by all tasks, pending tasks, and completed tasks.
You are able to check off the tasks you've completed and delete tasks you would like to remmove.



Implementation Manual:

My applicatoin uses 3 classes.

Task - contains attributes (description, date, time, completed) and methods(getters & setters and toString).

TaskController - handles all task operations such as storing all tasks, UI refresh, adds new task, deletes task, return all tasks, filters
and returns incomplete tasks. 

App - contains UI components, initializes the GUI, handles user inputs, event handlers.
